ODataOpenTypeSample
------------------

Entity or complex types which allow clients to persist additional undeclared properties are called open types. The additional undeclared properties are called dynamic properties.

Now WebApi OData only supports open complex type. In this sample the type Address is the open complex type.
This sample illustrates:

1. Build the edm model,
2. Add/update an entity object with open complex type.
3. Query open complex type

It is a console application, just open the solution and hit F5 to run it.

Todo sample
----------------

This sample illustrates how to write multiple secure clients (browser, Windows Phone,
Windows Store) that consume the same backend Web API.

The client logic for this sample is implemented using portable libraries so that the
logic can be shared between the Windows Phone and Windows Store clients.

The test project shows how to test the entire OAuth 2.0 based security flows by
hosting Web API and the OWIN pipeline in memory using the 
Microsoft.Owin.Testing package.
